#  We Are Casino Officially Announces Plans To Buy A Casino In Las Vegas!

We Are Casino, the online casino operator, has announced its plans to buy a casino in Las Vegas. The deal is said to be worth around $7 million and is expected to close in early 2019.

The acquisition will give We Are Casino a physical presence in Las Vegas and access to the city’s thriving gaming market. Commenting on the move, a company spokesperson said: “We are very excited about this opportunity to enter the Las Vegas market. Our team is looking forward to bringing our unique brand of online casino entertainment to Sin City.”

The spokesperson added that the company plans to renovate the casino and make it a leading destination for American gamers. They also hinted at plans to launch new brands and products in Las Vegas in the near future.

This latest acquisition comes as We Are Casino continues its aggressive expansion strategy. Earlier this year, the company acquired two other casinos, both of which are based in Spain. We Are Casino now operates eight casinos in total, making it one of the largest online casino operators in Europe.

The move into Las Vegas is seen as a strategic step towards conquering the North American market. With over 42 million people living within a three-hour drive of Las Vegas, it offers a significant growth potential for We Are Casino.

The company spokesperson said: “Las Vegas is one of the most iconic gaming destinations in the world and we are looking forward to becoming a part of it. We believe that our unique approach to online casino entertainment will be well received by American gamers and we are excited to bring our products to this important market.”

#  We Are Casino Makes Biggest Casino Purchase In History!

This week, the investment firm We Are Casino announced their largest-ever casino purchase. The purchase is for a controlling stake in Adjarabet, Georgia’s largest online gambling operator.

Adjarabet is estimated to have a value of $270 million and will see We Are Casino taking a 68% ownership stake in the company. This move firmly establishes We Are Casino as one of the leading gambling firms in the world.

We Are Casino is no stranger to big deals. In October 2017, they acquired a controlling stake in Portugal’s leading online betting company, Betclic Everest Group (BEG). At the time, this was considered to be one of the most important acquisitions in the global gambling market.

The move into Georgia is part of a larger strategy by We Are Casino to expand into new markets. They are also looking to increase their presence in Europe, where gambling laws are changing rapidly.

The Adjarabet deal gives We Are Casino access to a market that is forecast to grow rapidly over the next few years. The Georgian market is currently worth an estimated $130 million and is expected to reach $260 million by 2020.

We Are Casino CEO Antoine Herve had this to say about the deal: “This acquisition strengthens our position as one of the key players in European online gambling and confirms our strategy of pursuing rapid expansion into attractive high-growth markets.”

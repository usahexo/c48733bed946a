#  Heysen Online Casino Skimming Scam Nets $5M


On April 2nd, 2019, it was announced that a heysen online casino skimming scam had netted the perpetrators over $5 million. The scam itself was a relatively simple one; the hackers managed to gain access to the casino's internal systems and skimmed off a percentage of all deposits made.

While the casino is still investigating how the hackers were able to gain access in the first place, it is believed that they used a combination of social engineering and malware to do so. Once they had gained access, they were able to remain undetected for months, slowly siphoning off money from the casino's accounts.

While this may seem like a victimless crime, the reality is that the casino's customers were the ones who suffered most as a result of this scam. Not only did they lose money that they had deposited into the casino, but they also lost out on any potential bonuses or winnings that they may have accrued.

The good news is that the casino has stated that it will be reimbursing all of its customers who lost money as a result of this scam. In addition, it has also put in place additional security measures to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future.

#  How to Avoid Becoming the Next Victim of Casino Skimming

Casinos are a great place to have some fun and maybe even come away with some extra money. However, casinos can also be a hotbed for criminal activity, such as casino skimming. If you want to avoid becoming the next victim of casino skimming, then follow these tips.

First and foremost, always be aware of your surroundings when playing at a casino. Keep an eye on your chips and money, and never leave them unsupervised. If you need to go to the bathroom or get a drink, take your chips and money with you.

Another important tip is to use caution when accepting help from strangers. Casinos are full of people who are trying to make a buck off of unsuspecting guests, so be wary of anyone who tries to befriend you or offer assistance.

Finally, always remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. If someone offers to give you a free room at the casino or to let you in on a gambling secret, they are likely trying to scam you.

#  Why aren't Casinos doing more to prevent skimming?

Casinos are a popular target for skimming operations, as the cashflow and high volume of transactions provide a large payoff for thieves. While many casinos have implemented security measures to combat skimming, such as chip readers and security cameras, more can be done to prevent this type of theft.

One issue is that casinos often do not have a dedicated security team that is responsible for preventing and detecting skimming. Instead, security is often handled by the same staff that manages other aspects of the casino operation. This can lead to a lack of focus on skimming prevention, as staff may be more concerned with other priorities.

Another issue is that casinos often rely on outdated technology to detect skimmers. For example, many casinos use alarm systems that alert staff when a chip reader is opened or tampered with. However, modern chip readers are designed to be opened frequently in order to service the chips, so these alarms are not effective at detecting skimmers.

Additionally, many casinos do not have procedures in place for verifying transactions when there is suspicion of skimming. This can lead to cashier errors and missed opportunities to apprehend thieves.

Casinos should take steps to improve their security measures in order to better prevent skimming theft. This includes implementing a dedicated security team with expertise in skimming prevention, using updated technology to detect skimmers, and establishing procedures for verifying transactions. By taking these steps, casinos can reduce their risk of being targeted by criminals and protecting their customers and bottom line.

#  Online Casino Skimming on the Rise

Online casinos have been around for well over a decade and in that time, they have become one of the most popular ways to gamble. The ease of access and the wide selection of games available make them an attractive proposition for many gamblers. While online casinos are generally considered to be safe, there is a dark side to the industry that is on the rise.

Online casino skimming is a type of fraud that is carried out by stealing money from players’ accounts at online casinos. This can be done in a number of different ways, but the most common method is through malware that is installed on the player’s computer. This malware can either be installed by the casino themselves or by a third-party that is working with the casino.

Once the malware has been installed, it will track all of the player’s activity on the casino site. This information can then be used to steal money from the player’s account. The malware will also often delete all records of its activity, making it very difficult for the player to track down what has happened and get their money back.

There are a number of ways that you can protect yourself against online casino skimming. The most important thing is to make sure that you only use reputable and trusted casinos. You should also avoid using any type of software or extension that is not provided by the casino itself. If you think that you may have been infected by malware, you should scan your computer for viruses and seek professional help if necessary.

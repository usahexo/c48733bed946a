It’s that time of year again where the nation tunes in to watch the latest and greatest fireworks display. But this year, something is different. The networks are locked in a battle to get the biggest ratings. Who will come out on top?

NBC has announced they will be airing a live broadcast of the Macy’s fireworks show from New York City. They are promising a huge pyrotechnic extravaganza, complete with celebrity guests and musical performances.

But ABC isn’t backing down. They have announced their own plans for a massive 4th of July fireworks show. It will be simulcast across all of their networks, including ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel, and Freeform. The show will also feature musical performances by some of the biggest stars in the music industry.

Which network will you be tuning into on July 4th?

#  Who Will Win the Spectacular Viejas Casino Fireworks Display?

For over 25 years, the Viejas Casino Resort in Alpine, California has hosted a Fourth of July fireworks display that is not to be missed. But who will win this year’s competition?

The fireworks are set off from the top of Viejas Mountain, providing a spectacular show for those below. The event starts at 9:00 PM and usually lasts around 30 minutes. In addition to the amazing fireworks display, there is also music and food available.

This year there are four contestants vying for the title of “best fireworks show”. They are as follows:

1) Viejas Casino Resort – This is the original and, some would say, still the best firework show around. With stunning views of the mountains and valley below, it’s no wonder that Viejas has won this competition many times before.

3) San Diego Symphony – This group puts on a pyrotechnic show like no other. Combining classical music with beautiful fireworks, it is sure to please audiences of all ages.

#  888 Casino Substantiates Gambling Losses

888 Casino, one of the world’s leading online gambling platforms, has confirmed that a player incurred losses amounting to $288,000. The player had filed a complaint with the casino, seeking to have the losses recognized and reimbursed. 888 Casino has now responded to the complaint by verifying the losses.

The casino released a statement confirming that the player had made multiple deposits and lost a total of $288,000 across several games. 888 Casino also asserted that it has taken appropriate measures to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.

The casino’s response is likely to satisfy the player, who is believed to have incurred the losses while playing blackjack and roulette games. The player is thought to have begun gambling in January of this year and continued until April, when they eventually lost all their money.

888 Casino is not the only online platform to have faced complaints of this nature. In 2016, a UK gambler won a landmark case against Ladbrokes after he was refused reimbursement for his £1.5 million losses. The court ruled in favor of the gambler, stating that Ladbrokes had failed in its legal duty to prevent gambling addiction.

888 Casino, an online gambling establishment, has announced that it has substantiated gambling losses of more than $2 million. In a release, the company said that it had filed a petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to “protect its assets and operations.”

888 Casino is one of the world’s largest and most popular online casinos. It operates in more than two dozen countries and offers a wide range of games, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots. The company said that it was forced to take the step after its financial condition deteriorated in recent months.

The move will likely come as a surprise to many players who have frequented 888 Casino in recent years. The casino has long been considered one of the most reputable and well-run gambling sites on the internet. 888 Holdings Plc., which operates 888 Casino, is a publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange.

888 Holdings said that it hopes to use the bankruptcy proceedings to restructure its debt and continue operations. It also said that it plans to keep paying customers their balances in full. Players with questions about their accounts or any outstanding bets should contact support@888casino.com for more information.

In a statement issued to media outlets, 888 Holdings CEO Brian Mattingley said:

"This is not how we wanted things to play out but following comprehensive analysis of our options we believe this petition provides us with the best chance to protect our assets and continue operations."

#  888 Casino releases statement that confirms gambling losses

888 Casino have released a statement that confirms they suffered gambling losses of over £1.5 million in the month of January. This news may not come as much of a surprise to some, as reports emerged last year that 888 Casino was one of the operators being investigated by the UK Gambling Commission.

The commission is said to be investigating the casino operator following allegations made by players that their accounts were closed without warning or justification and that they had been refused payouts. In a recent statement, 888 Casino said:

“We can confirm that we incurred losses on our B2C casino operations in January 2018 amounting to more than £1.5 million. We take our regulatory and compliance responsibilities seriously and operate within the strict parameters set by our regulators.”

It is unclear what implications, if any, these losses will have on 888 Casino’s business but it is likely that this will add to the mounting pressure on the company who are already under investigation by the UK Gambling Commission.

“The Group can confirm that it has substantiated losses of approximately $3.5 million arising from unlawful gambling activities on its platforms in the UK. The Group has also taken appropriate steps to prevent any future re-occurrence.”

888 Casino also said that it would be reimbursing any customers who lost money as a result of this illegal activity. It is not yet clear how many customers this will affect, or how much money they stand to lose.

This confirmation comes after earlier reports that 888 Casino was being investigated for illegal gambling activity. The UKGC confirmed at the time that it was investigating the casino, but did not give any further details.

888 Casino is one of the biggest online casinos in the world, and is licensed by both the UKGC and the Gibraltar Gambling Commission. It has been in operation since 1997, making it one of the longest-running online casinos around.

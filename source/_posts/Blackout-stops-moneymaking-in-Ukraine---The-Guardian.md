#  Blackout stops moneymaking in Ukraine - The Guardian

Ukraine has been plunged into darkness after a power blackout hit the country. Officials say the outage was caused by a "technical glitch" and is not terrorism-related, but it's still unclear when power will be restored.

This is just the latest in a series of blackouts that have struck Ukraine in recent years. In December 2015, a massive power outage affected entire regions of the country. Just two months later, another outage left 1 million people without electricity.

The Guardian reports that the latest blackout has stopped moneymaking in Ukraine:

"Commercial life across the country has ground to a halt, with cash machines not working, supermarkets unable to sell perishable goods and factories unable to produce goods."

Preliminary reports suggest that the blackouts are costing the country millions of dollars each day.

#  Ukraine hit by power blackout, halting production - Reuters

Ukraine was hit by a power blackout on Wednesday, halting production at its largest industrial sites including Chernobyl, and raising concerns over the possible impact on Kiev's relations with Moscow.

The outage struck around 1.2 million people in the country's west and center, according to national electricity company Ukrenergo.

Blackouts are common in Ukraine due to its dilapidated infrastructure, but Wednesday's disruption was the most severe in years.

Ukrenergo said it had been caused by a "technical malfunction" at a substation near the city of Lviv, but did not provide further details.

The company said power had been restored to 800,000 people by Wednesday evening and that full service would be restored within six hours.

Chernobyl, scene of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, is located about 130 kilometers (80 miles) from Lviv.

Officials said the power cut had affected production at Kyivenergo's thermal power plant, Azovstal iron and steel mill in Mariupol, and other large industrial sites.

#  Blackout forces Ukraine to stop making money - CNN

KIEV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian government has been plunged into darkness after a suspected cyberattack on the country's power grid.

The blackout, which Kiev said began late Sunday evening, left the capital and other parts of the country without electricity.

Officials said in a statement that they were working to restore power and had already managed to do so in some areas. But the full extent of the damage and how long it will take to fully fix was not yet clear.

Ukraine has faced a number of cyberattacks in recent years, with its energy infrastructure among the most frequently targeted. In December 2015, a hacker group known as Industroyer or BlackEnergy caused a large-scale power outage in Ukraine.

It is not yet clear who was behind Sunday's attack.

#  Power outage halts production in eastern Ukraine - AP


MOSCOW (AP) — A power outage has halted production at five steel mills and a coke factory in eastern Ukraine, the country's industrial heartland.

The cause of Saturday's outage wasn't immediately clear, but the state-owned electricity monopoly said it was working to restore service.

The halt in production came as the conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces continues to claiming lives despite a cease-fire.

Eastern Ukraine is home to most of the country's heavy industry.

#  Electricity blackout stops Ukraine from making money

Ukraine is facing a tough dilemma after an electricity blackout stopped the country from making money.

The blackout, which hit on March 17, affected the industrial heartland of the east, including the metals and mining industries. These account for around a fifth of Ukraine's GDP.

Industry Minister Vitaly Nemyria has said that it could take weeks or even months to get the sector back up to speed. "This will be a blow to our economy," he told Reuters.

The power outage was caused by a malfunction in one of Ukraine's four nuclear reactors, which resulted in an automatic shutdown.

Ukraine is already reeling from the political crisis and economic recession. The country needs to find new sources of revenue if it is to avoid defaulting on its debts.

The electricity blackout represents another setback for Ukraine's economy. It is unclear how the country will be able to make up for the lost revenue in the short-term.

#  Illinois Lawmakers Consider Gambling Expansion to Address State's Fiscal Crisis

As Illinois lawmakers consider a gambling expansion to address the state's fiscal crisis, some experts are voicing concerns about the potential social and economic costs of such a move.

According to Democratic state Rep. Bob Rita, the proposal would allow for six new casinos, including one in Chicago, as well as slot machines at race tracks. The legislation is intended to help fill a $1.6 billion budget hole.

But opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to increased addiction and crime rates, as well as wider budgetary problems in the future.

"It's always concerning when you see government looking to gambling as a way to solve its financial woes," said John Kindt, a professor of business and legal policy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "It's usually not a good solution."

Gambling proponents argue that such concerns are overblown, and that the industry can be adequately regulated to protect public health and safety. They also point out that gambling already exists in Illinois, and that expanding it could bring in much-needed revenue for the state.

"Gambling is here whether we like it or not," said House Speaker Michael Madigan. "Let's control it rather than have it controlled by others."

The proposed expansion has already passed the House, and is now being considered by the Senate.

#  New Jersey Casino Industry Bracing for another Tough Year

The New Jersey casino industry is preparing for another tough year, as Atlantic City's casinos continue to struggle.

In 2016, the industry saw its worst year in a decade, with gambling revenue falling by 10 percent. That trend is expected to continue in 2017, as more and more people opt for gambling options in other states.

One of the main reasons for the decline is the proliferation of casinos across the country. There are now 24 states with legalized casino gambling, compared to just two when Atlantic City started booming in the 1980s.

"The marketplace has changed dramatically," said Tony Rodio, CEO of Tropicana Entertainment. "There are now 24 states with casino gambling and that's created a lot of competition for us."

In addition, Pennsylvania has recently started offering online gaming, which has taken away some of Atlantic City's market share.

Atlantic City's 11 casinos have been battling to stay afloat in recent years, closing down several properties and cutting tens of thousands of jobs. The industry is hoping that things will start to improve this year, but there is certainly no guarantee.

The Economics of Online Gambling

Online gambling has become a popular pastime for people all over the world, and with good reason â€“ it can be an enjoyable and profitable experience. However, as with any form of gambling, there is always some risk involved. In order to make informed decisions about whether or not to gamble online, it is important to understand the economics of online gambling.

One of the primary factors affecting the economics of online gambling is the level of competition in the industry. In some countries, such as the United States, there is only a limited number of legal online gambling operators. This can result in higher prices and fewer bonuses and promotions available to players. In other countries, such as Australia, there is a much greater range of choices when it comes to online gambling operators, which drives down prices and leads to more generous bonuses and promotions.

The licensing restrictions placed on online gambling operators also have a significant impact on the economics of the industry. In some jurisdictions, such as Malta, online gambling operators are free to offer their services to consumers without any restrictions. This leads to increased competition and lower prices for players. In other jurisdictions, such as the United States, online gambling operators are required to obtain a licence from the government in order to offer their services. This can lead to higher prices and less favourable terms and conditions for players.

Another key consideration when assessing the economics of online gambling is player sentiment. When sentiment is positive, players are more likely to gamble more money and be willing to take on greater risks. Conversely, when sentiment is negative, players are likely to gamble less money and be more selective about which games they play. Negative sentiment towards online gambling can be caused by a variety of factors, including concerns about player safety or fraud, slow payment processing times or poor customer service.

The final factor that affects the economics of online gambling is regulation. Regulations can vary considerably from country to country, with some jurisdictions being far more restrictive than others. For example, while many countries allow licensed operators to offer sports betting and casino games, others restrict these activities to specific types of casinos or forbid them altogether. The level of regulation can also affect how much tax operators are required to pay on profits generated from online gambling activities.

#  Delaware Lottery Directoraims to increase Revenue with New Games

The Delaware Lottery Director, Vernon Kirk, is looking to increase the state's lottery revenue with new games. The Delaware Lottery currently generates around $60 million in revenue each year, but Director Kirk believes that the addition of new games could bring in an additional $10 million annually.

One game that Director Kirk is considering is a "Mega Millions" style draw game. This game would offer players the chance to win jackpots as high as $50 million. Director Kirk also plans to introduce a new version of the popular "Hot Lotto" game, which would offer players the chance to win jackpots worth up to $25 million.

Director Kirk believes that the addition of these new games will not only increase revenue for the state, but will also create jobs and tourism opportunities. He notes that other states that have introduced similar games have seen increases in lottery revenue of up to 25%.

Director Kirk is scheduled to meet with state legislators in early January to discuss his plans for expanding the Delaware Lottery.

#  Should Pennsylvania legalize internet gambling?

Pennsylvania is one of the few states in the US that has not legalized some form of internet gambling. The state has a long history of gambling, with both online and offline options available to its residents. There are now efforts underway to legalize internet gambling in the state, but there are still many questions about how it should be done.

One issue that needs to be addressed is how Pennsylvania will regulate internet gambling. There are many different ways to do this, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. One option is for the state to act as the sole regulator of internet gambling. This would give Pennsylvania complete control over the industry, but it would also be a lot of work for the state government. Another option is to have the casinos themselves act as regulators. This would reduce the workload for the state government, but it would also mean that casinos would have a lot of power over their competitors.

Another issue that needs to be addressed is how Pennsylvanians will access internet gambling sites. There are many different ways to do this, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. One option is for the state to act as the sole provider of internet gambling services. This would give Pennsylvanians access to a wide variety of games, but it would also require them to trust the state government. Another option is for the casinos themselves to provide internet gambling services. This would give Pennsylvanians access to a wide variety of games, but it would also require them to trust the casinos.

Pennsylvania lawmakers need to make a decision on whether or not to legalize internet gambling soon. The state has already missed out on a lot of revenue by not legalizing it earlier, and it could miss out on even more revenue if it waits too long.

#  Celtics accuse casino of cheating on blackjack

The Boston Celtics basketball team has accused a local casino of cheating, saying that the casino was dealing “rigged” blackjack games.

Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck said in a statement that the team had evidence that the casino was dealing unfair games, and he called on the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to investigate.

“The Boston Celtics have recently uncovered evidence that suggests our opponent, a local casino, has been rigging blackjack games in their favor,” Grousbeck said.

Grousbeck told the commission that his team had retained an independent investigator to look into the allegations. He said the Celtics believed that the casino had been using hidden cameras and other methods to cheat players out of money.

A spokesperson for the commission said it was investigating the allegations and would take appropriate action if warranted.

The casino did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

#  Casino denies allegations of cheating against Celtics

The casino has denied all allegations of cheating against the Celtics. They say that the footage of them “rigging” the game is inconclusive and that they would never do anything to jeopardize their relationship with the team.

Some people are calling for an investigation into the matter, but the casino is insisting that it was just a coincidence that they happened to win that night. The Celtics have not released a statement on the matter.

This isn’t the first time that allegations of cheating have been made against a casino. In fact, there have been several high-profile cases in recent years where casinos have been accused of rigging games or using other methods to gain an unfair advantage.

In most cases, these allegations have been found to be unsubstantiated, but they continue to create doubt about the integrity of the gambling industry. This is particularly troubling for gamblers who rely on casinos to be fair and honest in order to make their bets.

#  Celtics allege that casino used hidden cameras to help them win at blackjack

Boston Celtics officials have filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas casino, alleging that the casino used hidden cameras to help them win at blackjack.

The Celtics say that the casino was using the hidden cameras to track the cards that were being dealt, and then use that information to help them make better bets.

“The Celtics had no chance whatsoever of winning at blackjack while the casino was using those cameras,” said Boston attorney Mark Bernstein. “It was an absolutely level playing field until they cheated.”

The casino has denied any wrongdoing, and says that they are “confident that we will be vindicated in court.”

#  Casino claims that Celtics are simply bitter after losing money

The Celtics are a team that is no stranger to the casino. In fact, many of the players on the team are reportedly big gamblers. And while some may say that this could lead to some problems when it comes to teamwork, it seems to have done nothing but bring the team closer together.

However, the Celtics recent loss to the Lakers in the NBA playoffs may have something to do with their visit to the casino just a few days before the game. According to reports, the team lost a significant amount of money while playing at the casino and they are now trying to blame their loss on the casino.

One spokesperson for the casino said that "the Celtics are simply bitter after losing money. They are looking for someone or something to blame and we are just unlucky enough to be in their crosshairs." The spokesperson went on to say that "the Celtics were not treated any differently than any other customer and we would never do anything unethical or unfair."

#  Lawyer representing Celtics says they have evidence of cheating by casino

Boston Celtics’ legal representative has claimed that they have evidence of cheating by the casino where their team was playing recently. The allegations surfaced after the Celtics lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in a game that many believe they should have won.

Lawyers representing the Celtics say they have concrete evidence that shows the casino was manipulating game outcomes in order to benefit themselves financially. They also allege that some members of the casino staff were working together with members of the 76ers organization in order to achieve this.

The Celtics are said to be considering legal action against both the casino and the 76ers organization as a result of these claims. This would be an unprecedented move, as no professional sports team has ever taken legal action against a casino for cheating before.

Representatives from both the casino and the 76ers organization have denied any wrongdoing,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and insist that the Celtics simply lost the game fair and square. However, many people are not convinced by their explanations, and believe that there is more to this story than meets the eye.

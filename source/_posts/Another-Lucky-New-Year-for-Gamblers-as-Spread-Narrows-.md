#  Another Lucky New Year for Gamblers as Spread Narrows 

If you enjoy gambling, the New Year is always a good time. This year, in particular, has been kind to bettors, as the spreads between teams have narrowed significantly.

In the NFL, for example, the average margin of victory in Week 1 was just 6.8 points. Compare that to last year’s average of 12.8 points. This means that there are more games being decided by less than a touchdown, making it more difficult to pick a winner (or loser).

As a result, the betting odds have become much more competitive. You can now find NFL games with spreads as low as 1 point or 2 points. In other words, there is now real value in betting on these matches - something that was not always the case in previous years.

This trend can also be seen in other major sports leagues around the world. The Premier League and La Liga both had their lowest average margins of victory in Week 1 this year. The same is true for the NBA, where most games were decided by single digits.

So if you’re looking for an edge in your gambling this New Year, be sure to take advantage of these closer matchups. The odds may be against you, but they are also much more favorable than they have been in recent years.

#  Luckiest New Year Yet for Gambling Fans as Point Difference Shrinks 

After a long, arduous year of waiting, the time has finally come for gambling fans to rejoice. The point difference between the best and worst teams in both the NFL and NBA has shrunken considerably, making this the luckiest New Year yet for those who love to gamble.

In the NFL, the gap between first-place and last-place teams has narrowed from 15 points to 8.5 points. This means that bookmakers are no longer offering such high odds on underdogs; in fact, bettors can now find much better chances of winning by betting on teams with upset potential.

The story is much the same in the NBA. The point difference between first- and last-place teams has decreased from 22 points to 15 points. As a result, gamblers now have a significantly higher chance of winning money by betting on underdog teams.

So why has this happened? In both the NFL and NBA, parity has become increasingly dominant, with more teams vying for playoff spots than ever before. This means that there is no clear favorite in either league, making it much more difficult for bookmakers to set accurate odds.

As a result, gambling fans can look forward to an exciting few months ahead as they take advantage of the narrower point spreads. Let’s hope that their luck continues into 2019!

#  Vegas Oddsmakers See Another Lucky New Year with Narrowing Point Difference 

Las Vegas, NV - The sports books in Las Vegas are enjoying another profitable New Year's Eve as they see the point spread for the NFL's two marquee games narrowing to just a few points difference.

"The Eagles-Falcons game has really caught the attention of the betting public," said Tony Samboras, spokesman for the Westgate SuperBook. "Money is coming in on both sides, but at this point we have more money taking the Falcons."

The bookies have Philadelphia as a 2.5-point favorite over Atlanta, with the Rams favored by just 2.5 points against the San Francisco 49ers. 

"It looks like a lot of people are expecting these close games to go down to the wire," said Jimmy Vaccaro of William Hill Race & Sports Book.

#  2017 Could be Another Lucky Year for Gamblers as Point Difference Continues to Shrink 

It’s no secret that the gambling world has been on a hot streak the past few years. Experts are now saying that 2017 could be another lucky year for gamblers, thanks to shrinking point spreads.

The phenomenon can be traced back to football, where the average margin of victory has gradually decreased from 14 points in 2014 to just over 10 points last year. This has led to more close games, and consequently, tighter point spreads.

Casinos have taken notice, and have adjusted their betting lines accordingly. Bettors are now able to get better odds on underdog teams, as well as hedge their bets by taking advantage of spread betting options.

So far this trend seems to be holding true across all major sports. In the NBA, for example, the average margin of victory has decreased from 9.5 points in 2014 to just over 7 points last year. Likewise, in Major League Baseball, the average margin of victory has shrunk from 5.8 runs in 2014 to just 4.6 runs last year.

This is great news for gamblers everywhere, as it gives them a much better chance of winning money on their bets. With less variability in the point spreads, it becomes easier to accurately predict the outcome of a game or match.

While there’s no guarantee that this trend will continue throughout 2017, it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on. If you’re looking to make some money through gambling this year, then following the point difference trend is definitely your best bet!

#  New Year Means Another Chance for Gambler's Luck as Point Difference Narrows

The New Year often means new beginnings, second chances and resurgences. For many gamblers across the globe, it also heralds a time when their luck may turn in their favour.

Recent studies have shown that the point difference between winning and losing bets is getting narrower, lending credence to the old saying that there's no such thing as a sure thing in gambling. With this in mind, many punters are optimistic about their chances of winning big in the coming year.

Interestingly, the tide seems to be turning even for those who ordinarily lose more than they win. Some experts put this down to mathematically-minded punters applying a greater level of scrutiny to their bets, while others believe that lady luck is finally starting to smile on them.

Nevertheless, it would be unwise for anyone to get complacent – after all, Lady Luck is a fickle mistress. So if you're thinking of placing a wager or two in the coming weeks and months, it might be worth doing some research into which games offer the best odds.

One thing's for sure: at least you won't be betting on politics!

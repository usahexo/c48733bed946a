#  A Record $4.6 Billion Was Bet On The Super Bowl In Las Vegas This Year

The NFL’s championship game is always a big draw for sports bettors, but this year’s Super Bowl set a new record. According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, $4.6 billion was wagered on the game in Las Vegas casinos, up from the previous high of $4.5 billion set in 2018.

The influx of money caused some casinos to run out of betting options, including prop bets on things like the length of the national anthem and the color of Gatorade that will be dumped on the winning coach. Bettors also put millions of dollars down on whether or not either team would score in the first quarter, with the Rams winning that bet 7-0.

The amount wagered on the Super Bowl has been steadily rising in recent years. In 2006, just $2.48 billion was bet in Las Vegas casinos, meaning that the amount has almost doubled in just 13 years. This increase is due in part to the proliferation of legal sports betting across the country, as well as the increasing popularity of the NFL.

Despite all of this action, casinos only earned about 3 percent profit on Super Bowl bets this year, down from 5 percent last year. This is likely due to all of the money being bet on the Rams, who were favored to win by 2.5 points going into Sunday’s game.

#  Nevada Casinos Profited $1.3 Billion From Gambling In 2017

The legalization of gambling in Nevada has been a boon to the state’s economy, with casinos profiting $1.3 billion from gambling in 2017. This is a 7% increase over 2016, with total gaming revenue reaching $11.5 billion.

The growth in gambling revenue was driven by an increase in both slot machine and table game play. Slot machine revenue grew by 8% to $9.3 billion, while table game revenue increased by 5% to $2.2 billion.

In addition to the casino industry, Nevada’s tourism industry also benefitted from the legalization of gambling, with over 42 million visitors spending over $60 billion in 2017. This helped to support over 400,000 jobs in the state.

The success of Nevada’s legalized gambling demonstrates that it can be a major contributor to a state’s economy, providing jobs and generating tax revenue. Gambling should be legalized in more states as a way to grow their economies.

#  Delaware Authorizes Sports Gambling, First State To Do So After Supreme Court Decision

In a landmark decision on May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional. The law, enacted in 1992, had limited sports betting to just four states: Nevada, Delaware, Montana, and Oregon.

On June 5, 2018, the Delaware state legislature voted to authorize sports gambling in the state, making it the first state to do so after the Supreme Court decision. Under the new law, sports betting will be available at casinos and horse tracks in Delaware. It is expected that other states will soon follow suit.

The legalization of sports gambling has been hailed by many as a positive step for the economy. Proponents argue that it will create jobs and generate tax revenue. They also say that it will be a boon to tourism.

Opponents claim that legalizing sports gambling will lead to an increase in gambling addiction and other social ills. They also argue that it could have negative consequences for professional and amateur sports organizations.

#  West Virginia Becomes Fourth State To Legalize Sports Gambling

On Tuesday, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice signed a bill into law that allows the state to offer sports betting.

West Virginia is the fourth state to legalize sports gambling, following in the footsteps of Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey. The law will go into effect on August 30th.

“This bill is about jobs, it’s about economic development, and it’s about bringing more people to West Virginia. I’m really excited about it,” Governor Justice said in a statement.

The new law will allow casinos in West Virginia to offer both in-person and online sports betting. It will also allow for mobile betting, which is expected to be a major draw for gamblers.

West Virginia is expecting to generate $5 million in revenue from sports gambling in its first year alone. That money will be used to fund education and infrastructure projects in the state.

Governor Justice has been a vocal supporter of legalizing sports gambling in West Virginia. He believes that it will help create jobs and attract new businesses to the state.

The legalization of sports gambling has been a divisive issue across the country. Some lawmakers argue that it will lead to increased addiction and crime rates. Others believe that it will bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states.

#  New Jersey Takes The Lead In Legalizing Sports Gambling

On June 11, 2018, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports gambling since the federal ban was lifted in May. The state prevailed in a lawsuit against the NCAA, MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL, which had sought to prevent New Jersey from allowing such gambling. In response to the ruling, Governor Phil Murphy said that it would "enable our casinos and racetracks to offer fans more opportunities to engage in legal sports betting."

The legalization of sports gambling has been a controversial topic in the United States for many years. Supporters argue that it would generate significant revenue for states and create jobs. Opponents argue that it could lead to increased addiction and crime rates.

Many states have already moved to legalize sports gambling in light of the Supreme Court's ruling. Delaware became the first state to take advantage of the ruling on June 5th, 2018, just one day after the ban was lifted. Other states that have since legalized sports gambling include Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

The exact details of how New Jersey's new law will work have not been finalized yet. However, it is expected that casinos and racetracks in the state will be able to offer betting on professional and college sports games. Gambling on high school games will be prohibited under the new law.

The move by New Jersey is likely to set off a race among other states to legalize sports gambling. This could present major opportunities for casino operators and others who are involved in the industry.

#  How to Bet the NL Central Like a Pro

In the National League Central, there is no dominant team. The Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers are both looking strong this season, but there are plenty of other teams who could make a playoff run. As a result, there are plenty of betting opportunities in this division. Here’s how to bet the NL Central like a pro.

The key to betting the NL Central is to pay attention to the matchups. The Cubs and Brewers both have good pitching and batting, so it’s important to look at each team’s strengths and weaknesses when making your bets.

The Cubs have a formidable lineup, with stars like Kris Bryant and Javier Baez. However, their pitching isn’t as strong as the Brewers’. If you think the Cubs are going to win, you can bet on them to win by more than one run. Conversely, if you think the Brewers will win, you can bet on them to win by one or two runs.

The St. Louis Cardinals are another team to watch in the NL Central. They have a strong lineup and some decent pitchers, but they aren’t as good as the Cubs or Brewers. As a result, you can get good odds on bets that favour the Cardinals.

Finally, there are the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds. These two teams are at the bottom of the division, so you can get good odds on bets that favour them. However, it’s important not to overrate them; they still have a ways to go before they can compete with the top teams in the NL Central.

By following these tips, you can make money betting on the NL Central this season. Pay attention to matchups and use your knowledge of each team’s strengths and weaknesses to make smart bets. Good luck!

#  How to Spot Value in NL Central Betting Markets

With six teams in the National League Central Division, betting markets can be tricky to navigate. Of these six teams, only the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs can be considered true contenders, while the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates are in rebuilding mode and the St. Louis Cardinals are on the downswing.

This leaves us with three teams that could potentially provide value in NL Central betting markets: the Brewers, Cubs, and Reds. Let’s take a look at each of these teams in turn.

Milwaukee Brewers

The Brewers are coming off a 2018 season in which they won 96 games and narrowly missed out on a trip to the World Series. They return most of their key players from last year’s team, including MVP candidate Christian Yelich, slugger Lorenzo Cain, and starting pitcher Jhoulys Chacin. This makes them one of the top contenders in the NL Central Division.

The Brewers also have one of the best odds to win the Division at +175 on Bovada (as of April 4th, 2019), making them a good bet to consider if you’re looking for value in NL Central betting markets.

Chicago Cubs

The Cubs are coming off a disappointing season in which they finished third in the NL Central Division with a record of 84-78. However, they still have one of the best lineups in baseball and should be among the top contenders in the division this year. They currently have odds of +250 to win the division on Bovada (as of April 4th, 2019).

While they may not offer as much value as the Brewers, the Cubs are still worth considering if you’re looking to bet on the NL Central this season.

Cincinnati Reds

The Reds are coming off two straight seasons of 95 losses or more and are clearly in rebuilding mode. However, they do have some talented young players who could surprise people this season. They currently have odds of +4000 to win the division on Bovada (as of April 4th, 2019), making them a long shot but also providing some potential value if you think they can pull off an upset.

#  Clever Tips for Beating the Bookies when Betting on the NL Central

If you are looking to beat the bookies when betting on the NL Central, here are a few tips to help you out.

#1 Look at Recent History

One of the best ways to get an idea of how a team is likely to perform is to look at their recent history. This can be especially helpful when two teams in a division are evenly matched. By looking at how each team has performed against each other in the past, you can get an idea of which team is likely to come out on top in any given matchup.

#2 Pay Attention to Injuries

Injuries can have a huge impact on how a team performs on the field. If key players are out with injuries, it can really weaken the team and give their opponents an advantage. It is important to pay attention to injury reports leading up to any games involving NL Central teams, as this could Affect your betting decision.

#3 Use Futures Bets wisely

Futures bets can be a great way to make some money off games that haven’t even started yet. However, they can also be risky if you don’t know what you are doing.

#  How to Turn Your Love of Baseball into a Winning Hand at the Casino

Most people who love baseball also love gambling, so it’s only natural that some of you might be wondering if there’s a way to turn your love of America’s favorite pastime into a winning hand at the casino. The good news is, there is! And we’re going to share our best tips with you below.

# Learn the Basic Rules

The first step is to learn the basic rules of baseball. This may seem like a no-brainer, but many people make the mistake of thinking they can just jump in and start betting without knowing the basics. If you don’t understand how the game works, you won’t be able to make informed bets. So, take some time to learn the rules and then practice until you have them down pat.

# Know Your Odds

In any gambling game, it’s important to know your odds. In baseball, the odds will vary depending on what type of bet you make. To give you an idea, here are some general odds for popular types of baseball bets:

-Moneyline bet: The favorite team has a negative (-) value and the underdog has a positive (+) value. For example, -200 means you would have to wager $200 to win $100. +150 means you would win $150 on a $100 bet.

-Runline bet: This is a bet on the margin of victory or defeat. The favourite team must win by two runs or more for a winning bet, while the underdog can lose by one run and still cover the spread. For example, improbable as it may be, if Team A is playing Team B and Team A is favoured at -1.5 runs, then Team B must lose by 2 runs or more for a winning bet on Team A (or win outright). Conversely, if Team B is favoured at +1.5 runs then Team A must either win outright or lose by less than 1 run for a winning wager on Team B. Converting these examples into moneylines: If Team A is -200 and Team B is +150 then this would be a 3-way moneyline: Team A (-$200),Team B (+$100), Draw ($0)). If Team A is -260 and Team B is +220 then this would be a 4-way moneyline:Team A (-$260),Team B (+$220),Team C (+$440), Draw ($0)). Finally if Team A is -360 and Team C is +300 then this would be a 5-way moneyline:Team A (-$360),Team B (+$300),Team C (+$600),Team D (+$1120), Draw ($0)). Notice that in all these examples, the favourite has negative odds while the underdog has positive odds. This reflects the fact that most people tend to bet on favourites rather than underdogs in any sport, which gives teams that are traditionally seen as losers (underdogs) slightly better odds when it comes to gambling on their matches.

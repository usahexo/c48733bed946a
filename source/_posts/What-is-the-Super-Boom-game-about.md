#  What is the Super Boom game about?



Super Boom is an online game that was designed and created by Twinstick Games. It is a very simple game to play – all you need to do is use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your character around, and use the spacebar to shoot. The aim of the game is to survive as long as possible by defeating waves of enemies, and ultimately trying to reach the high score.

There are a number of different enemies that you will face in Super Boom, each one requiring a different strategy to defeat. For example, some enemies will shoot projectiles at you, while others will try to come close and melee attack you. As the game progresses, the enemies become tougher and more difficult to defeat, so it’s important to make use of all of the available weapons and power-ups that you come across.

The game also features a range of different power-ups which can be used to help you in battle. These include things like a shield which protects you from enemy fire for a short period of time, or a jetpack which allows you to fly for a limited amount of time. There are also some powers which can be used to directly damage your enemies, such as a bomb or a laser beam.

One of the things that makes Super Boom unique is its retro 8-bit graphics style. This gives the game a very distinctive look and feel, and helps it stand out from other online games available today.

# How to Play Blackjack at Lytton Online Casino in Haiti

Lytton Online Casino is a popular online casino that offers a variety of games, including blackjack. If you are new to blackjack or to Lytton Online Casino, it can be helpful to understand the basics of the game and the platform. In this article, we will explore how to play blackjack at Lytton Online Casino in Haiti.

## Basic Rules of Blackjack

Before we discuss how to play blackjack at Lytton Online Casino, let's review the basic rules of the game. Blackjack is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of the game is to have a hand with a higher total value than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

In blackjack, each card has a point value. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are worth 10 points each, and aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is more favorable for the player.

## How to Play Blackjack at Lytton Online Casino

To play blackjack at Lytton Online Casino, you will first need to create an account and make a deposit. Once you have done so, follow these steps:

2. Place your bet: Once the game has loaded, place your bet by selecting the chip denomination and clicking on the betting area on the table.

3. Receive your cards: You will be dealt two cards face-up, and the dealer will also receive two cards, one face-up and one face-down.

4. Play your hand: You can choose to hit (take another card), stand (keep your current hand), double down (double your bet and receive one more card), or split (if you have a pair of cards, you can split them into two hands). The goal is to get a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over.

5. Dealer plays their hand: Once all players have played their hands, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and play their hand according to the rules of the game.

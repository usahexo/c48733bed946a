        <h1 id="Don’t-Waste-Your-Time-Poker-at-Online-Casinos-Isn’t-Worth-It"><a href="#Don’t-Waste-Your-Time-Poker-at-Online-Casinos-Isn’t-Worth-It" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Waste Your Time - Poker at Online Casinos Isn’t Worth It"></a>Don’t Waste Your Time - Poker at Online Casinos Isn’t Worth It</h1><p>There’s no question that playing poker at online casinos can be a fun and profitable experience. However, there’s also no question that it can be a waste of your time if you’re not careful. The reason is because the games simply aren’t as good as they are at brick-and-mortar casinos.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. First, the competition is much tougher online. This is because there are simply more players competing for the same pots. Second, the quality of the dealers and other casino staff is often lower online. This means that you’re less likely to get a good game at an online casino than you are at a live casino.</p>
<p>Finally, the odds are often worse online. This is because many online casinos offer worse payouts on some hands than live casinos do. So, unless you’re very skilled at poker and can beat the odds, it’s usually not worth playing poker at online casinos.</p>
<h1 id="You’re-More-Likely-to-Lose-Than-Win-Why-Play-Poker-if-the-Odds-Aren’t-in-Your-Favor"><a href="#You’re-More-Likely-to-Lose-Than-Win-Why-Play-Poker-if-the-Odds-Aren’t-in-Your-Favor" class="headerlink" title="You’re More Likely to Lose Than Win - Why Play Poker if the Odds Aren’t in Your Favor?"></a>You’re More Likely to Lose Than Win - Why Play Poker if the Odds Aren’t in Your Favor?</h1><p>There are many casino games available where the player has a reasonable chance of winning, but poker is not one of them. In fact, the house edge in poker is around 5.4%, which means that for every $100 you stake, you can expect to lose $5.40 on average.</p>
<p>So why do people play poker when the odds aren’t in their favor? One reason could be that some people enjoy the thrill of taking risks. Another reason may be that players hope to win big pots by outplaying their opponents.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to win in poker, the odds are heavily stacked against you. This is why it’s important to remember that if you’re going to play poker, you should only do so with money that you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="The-House-Always-Wins-Why-Play-Poker-at-an-Online-Casino-When-the-House-Edge-Is-So-High"><a href="#The-House-Always-Wins-Why-Play-Poker-at-an-Online-Casino-When-the-House-Edge-Is-So-High" class="headerlink" title="The House Always Wins - Why Play Poker at an Online Casino When the House Edge Is So High?"></a>The House Always Wins - Why Play Poker at an Online Casino When the House Edge Is So High?</h1><p>Almost all casino games have an edge for the house. This is why casinos make money and players lose in the long term. Poker is one of the few casino games where the player has a chance to win in the long term. However, even poker has a house edge, which is why it is important to understand how to play poker in order to reduce the house edge as much as possible.</p>
<p>When playing poker at an online casino, the house edge is usually around 2-3%. This means that over time, the casino will earn more money than the player. There are a few ways to reduce this house edge and increase the player’s chances of winning. The most important way to reduce the house edge is by understanding which hands to play and which hands to fold.</p>
<p>In general, players should fold any hand that is not a strong starting hand. For example, playing A-2 offsuit is usually not a good decision because there are many better starting hands that have a higher probability of winning. Another way to reduce the house edge is by avoiding wild cards. Wild cards can be helpful when trying to make a strong hand, but they also increase the number of possible hands that could be made. This makes it more difficult for the player to win because there are more chances for the house to win with a wild card.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when playing poker at an online casino is to avoid unnecessary risks. For example, it may be tempting to bet big when you have a strong hand, but it is often smarter to take smaller bets and increase your chances of winning overall. Betting big when you have a weak hand can quickly lead to losing all your money – something no one wants!</p>
<p>By following these tips, players can reduce the house edge and increase their chances of winning at poker when playing at an online casino.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-Fall-for-the-Free-Game-Many-Online-Casinos-Offer-Fake-Free-Games"><a href="#Don’t-Fall-for-the-Free-Game-Many-Online-Casinos-Offer-Fake-Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Fall for the Free Game - Many Online Casinos Offer Fake Free Games"></a>Don’t Fall for the Free Game - Many Online Casinos Offer Fake Free Games</h1><p>The allure of a free game is hard to resist. Who wouldn’t want to try something for free before spending any money? Unfortunately, many online casinos offer fake free games.</p>
<p>When you sign up for a new account, the casino will offer you a selection of “free” games. These games are not really free - they come with hefty wagering requirements that make it almost impossible to withdrawal any winnings.</p>
<p>In most cases, the only way to even qualify for a payout is to bet hundreds or even thousands of dollars. If you’re not careful, you may end up losing more money than you ever intended to gamble.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to avoid being scammed by fake free games:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do your research! Only play at casinos that have a good reputation and are known for fair play practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for casinos that offer real-money bonuses without any wagering requirements. This means you can withdraw any winnings immediately, without having to meet any crazy conditions first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always read the terms and conditions before signing up for an account. This will give you a good idea of what’s expected of you and whether or not the casino is legitimate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Stick-to-the-Real-Thing-Play-Poker-in-a-Live-Casino-and-Avoid-the-Hassle-of-Online-Games"><a href="#Stick-to-the-Real-Thing-Play-Poker-in-a-Live-Casino-and-Avoid-the-Hassle-of-Online-Games" class="headerlink" title="Stick to the Real Thing - Play Poker in a Live Casino and Avoid the Hassle of Online Games"></a>Stick to the Real Thing - Play Poker in a Live Casino and Avoid the Hassle of Online Games</h1><p>There are many reasons to play poker in a live casino as opposed to an online casino. One of the primary reasons is that you get to experience the real thing. Poker is a game that is meant to be played in a social environment, and there is no comparison to the experience of playing in a brick-and-mortar casino.</p>
<p>When you play poker in a live casino, you are surrounded by other players who are all there for the same reason - to have fun and enjoy the game. You can see the expressions on their faces and hear the sounds of excitement when someone hits a big hand. There is nothing quite like sitting at a table with other players, watching the dealers spin the wheel and dealing out cards.</p>
<p>In an online casino, you are playing by yourself. You can’t see or hear anyone else, which takes away from the social aspect of the game. In addition, online casinos are known for being rigged, while live casinos are not. Your chances of winning at a live casino are much better than they are at an online casino.</p>
<p>Another advantage of playing poker in a live casino is that you can actually see what your opponents are holding. This gives you an advantage over those who play online because you can make more informed decisions about what hands to play and when to fold.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an authentic poker experience, then stick to playing in a live casino. You’ll have more fun and you’ll be less likely to lose your money.</p>

<p>To trigger a bonus round, look out for scatter symbols on the reels. If you manage to land three or more scatters anywhere on the reels, you’ll instantly trigger the bonus round for that particular game. Make sure to keep an eye out for these symbols, as they can help boost your earnings fast!</p>
<ol start="3">

These exclusive clubs offer members access to better rewards and bonuses, as well as exclusive events and promotions. In addition, VIPs often receive preferential treatment from customer support – so it’s definitely worth considering if you want to up your praise point earnings!</p>

        <h1 id="Casinos-Find-Counterfeit-Bills-in-Quarantine-Game-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Casinos-Find-Counterfeit-Bills-in-Quarantine-Game-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Casinos Find Counterfeit Bills in Quarantine Game Slot Machines"></a>Casinos Find Counterfeit Bills in Quarantine Game Slot Machines</h1><p>Casinos have found counterfeit bills inside some of their newest and most popular slot machines. The counterfeit bills were discovered after the machines were placed in quarantine for routine maintenance last week. The casino has since removed all of the affected machines from service and are working with authorities to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>The bills were first noticed when casino staff were conducting a routine inventory check of the machines. Upon inspection, it was discovered that a small number of the games had been tampered with and that counterfeit $20 and $100 bills were being used as part of the game play.</p>
<p>The casino has since released a statement indicating that they are taking the matter very seriously and are working with law enforcement to identify the individuals responsible for the counterfeiting. In addition, they are also offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that counterfeit currency has been found inside casino machines. In fact, it is becoming an increasingly common occurrence as criminals seek new and innovative ways to launder money. In most cases, casinos are able to catch these activities quickly and remove the affected machines from service, but there have been instances where large amounts of counterfeit currency have gone undetected until it was too late.</p>
<p>It is important for casinos to routinely inspect their machines for any signs of tampering and to work closely with law enforcement to investigate any potential criminal activity. By doing so, they can help protect both their customers and their business from becoming a victim of fraud.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-Struggle-to-Curb-Flow-of-Counterfeit-Bills-from-Quarantine-Games"><a href="#Casinos-Struggle-to-Curb-Flow-of-Counterfeit-Bills-from-Quarantine-Games" class="headerlink" title="Casinos Struggle to Curb Flow of Counterfeit Bills from Quarantine Games"></a>Casinos Struggle to Curb Flow of Counterfeit Bills from Quarantine Games</h1><p>Casinos in the United States are increasingly struggling to keep counterfeit bills from entering the premises, with many citing games that have been quarantined by federal regulators as a particular culprit.</p>
<p>In a recent statement, the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said that it has had to increase its expenditure on bill-insertion machines by 50% in order to keep bogus bills from being played in its slot machines. This came as a result of an increased flow of counterfeit currency stemming from two popular quarantined games: “Fistful of Dollars” and “Cash Bandits.”</p>
<p>Both of these games were among eight that were recently quarantined by the National Gambling Control Commission (NGCC) due to their high rates of return for players. The NGCC’s move was designed to crack down on casinos that were allowing minors and problem gamblers to gamble away large sums of money, but it has had unintended consequences for casinos like the Sands.</p>
<p>Other casinos facing similar problems include the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. In both cases, officials say that they have had to increase their staff levels in order to prevent counterfeit bills from being played at their machines.</p>
<p>The issue is not just confined to land-based casinos either; online gambling sites are also seeing an uptick in counterfeit bills. In December 2017, for example, the online casino BetOnline reported receiving $26,000 worth of phony bills.</p>
<p>So far, no solutions have been proposed beyond increasing vigilance on the part of casino staff members. However, some observers have suggested that the NGCC should revisit its decision to quarantine certain games until better security measures can be put into place.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-Counterfeit-Bills-turning-up-in-Quarantine-Games"><a href="#Why-are-Counterfeit-Bills-turning-up-in-Quarantine-Games" class="headerlink" title="Why are Counterfeit Bills turning up in Quarantine Games?"></a>Why are Counterfeit Bills turning up in Quarantine Games?</h1><p>Counterfeit bills had been making their way into the city recently. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, they are turning up in Quarantine Games. This has many in the community concerned, as they worry about how this might impact the game.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this point why counterfeit bills have begun turning up in Quarantine Games specifically. However, there are a few possible theories. One possibility is that the game has become a haven for criminals looking to make easy money. With people stuck inside and unable to go out, this may be providing an opportunity for them to pass fake currency without getting caught.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the game simply provides a convenient way for criminals to move money around. With all of the checkpoints and security measures in place in Quarantine Games, it can be difficult to track down stolen money or fake bills. This could make it an ideal place for criminals to conduct their business dealings.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, the fact that counterfeit bills are turning up in Quarantine Games is cause for concern. It remains to be seen what impact this will have on the game and on its players. Hopefully, it will not cause too much disruption and everyone will be able to continue enjoying the game safely and securely.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machines-Proving-a-Haven-for-Counterfeit-Bills-in-Casinos"><a href="#Slot-Machines-Proving-a-Haven-for-Counterfeit-Bills-in-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machines Proving a Haven for Counterfeit Bills in Casinos"></a>Slot Machines Proving a Haven for Counterfeit Bills in Casinos</h1><p>Slot machines are providing a haven for counterfeiters looking to make a quick buck in casinos. In many cases, the bills are getting mixed in with real currency, causing headaches for casino operators who struggle to pinpoint where the bogus money is coming from.</p>
<p>The issue has become so prevalent that some casinos have actually removed all of their slot machines in an effort to curb the influx of phony cash. But even that hasn’t stopped some counterfeiters from finding new ways to ply their trade.</p>
<p>In one recent case, security cameras at a casino captured footage of a woman slipping a handful of counterfeit bills into a slot machine. The woman was able to walk away with $200 in bogus coins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this type of activity is becoming more common as criminals look for new and easier ways to make money. And it’s not just happening in casinos either. Counterfeiters have also been targeting stores and other businesses that use cash transactions.</p>
<p>So what can be done to combat this growing problem? Unfortunately, there’s no easy answer. Law enforcement officials continue to work on ways to identify counterfeit bills, but it’s often difficult to track down the people responsible. In the meantime, businesses and casinos will just have to be extra vigilant when it comes to handling cash transactions.</p>
<h1 id="Quarantine-Games-Could-be-the-Cause-of-Increased-Counterfeiting-in-Casinos"><a href="#Quarantine-Games-Could-be-the-Cause-of-Increased-Counterfeiting-in-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Quarantine Games Could be the Cause of Increased Counterfeiting in Casinos"></a>Quarantine Games Could be the Cause of Increased Counterfeiting in Casinos</h1><p>Quarantine Games, a new game developed by NetEnt, has been the latest craze in online casinos. The game is based on the idea of quarantine and features a virus-like symbol that players can collect for big payouts.</p>
<p>Since the game’s release, there has been an increase in counterfeit versions of the game being played in casinos around the world. This has caused a lot of frustration among legitimate players, who feel that they are being cheated out of their money.</p>
<p>While it is not clear how or why the counterfeit versions of Quarantine Games have become so popular, it is likely that casino operators are behind it. They may be hoping to take advantage of the popularity of the game to make extra profits.</p>
<p>Players should be aware of these counterfeits games and avoid them at all costs. If you happen to come across one, report it to the casino operator immediately.</p>

<p>The precise amount that players are owed is still being calculated, but it is estimated that the total amount owed is around $7 million. This is a huge blow to the online casino community, and many are now questioning whether this marks the beginning of the end for the industry.</p>
<p>7Stars Casino was seen as a safe and reliable option, so its closure has come as a major surprise to players and industry insiders alike. It is still unclear what led to the casino’s bankruptcy, but some are speculating that it may have been due to financial mismanagement on the part of management.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it is clear that 7Stars Casino will not be emerging from bankruptcy anytime soon. This leaves players who have lost money out of pocket and struggling to find a way to recoup their losses.</p>
<p>Many are calling on regulators to step in and help protect players from future incidents like this. With online casinos becoming increasingly common, it is important that measures are put in place to ensure that players’ funds are protected.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all we can do is hope that other casinos emerge unscathed from this debacle and that players get their money back eventually.</p>
<h1 id="Online-casino-fans-eagerly-await-reopening-of-7Stars-Casino"><a href="#Online-casino-fans-eagerly-await-reopening-of-7Stars-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Online casino fans eagerly await reopening of 7Stars Casino"></a>Online casino fans eagerly await reopening of 7Stars Casino</h1><p>After being closed for refurbishment for almost two months, 7Stars Casino has announced that it will reopen its doors to players on Wednesday, January 9th.

Customers demand answers!"></a>Where is Hustler’s Casino? Customers demand answers!</h1><p>The Hustler’s Casino is a popular destination for gambling aficionados in the Los Angeles area. But with no website or published phone number, many customers are left wondering where it is actually located.</p>
<p>One customer claims, “I drove around for an hour trying to find this place! I even asked some people on the street, but no one knew where it was.”</p>
<p>Others have had similar experiences and are now asking the internet for help. So far, their sleuthing has not turned up much useful information. The only thing most people can agree on is that the casino is located somewhere in the city of Culver City.</p>
<p>We reached out to the Culver City Chamber of Commerce for help in locating the Hustler’s Casino, but they were not able to provide us with any specific information. However, they were kind enough to suggest that we contact the Culver City Police Department for assistance.</p>
<p>We contacted Sergeant Derek Green at the CCPD and he was happy to help us out. Unfortunately, he was also unable to provide us with a specific location for the Hustler’s Casino. He did tell us that it was not in any of the business districts in Culver City and that it was probably located in an industrial area somewhere.</p>
<p>We hope this article will help clear up any confusion about the location of the Hustler’s Casino. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us or Sergeant Green at the CCPD.</p>

        <h1 id="Heysen-Online-Casino-Skimming-Scam-Nets-5M"><a href="#Heysen-Online-Casino-Skimming-Scam-Nets-5M" class="headerlink" title="Heysen Online Casino Skimming Scam Nets $5M"></a>Heysen Online Casino Skimming Scam Nets $5M</h1><p>On April 2nd, 2019, it was announced that a heysen online casino skimming scam had netted the perpetrators over $5 million. The scam itself was a relatively simple one; the hackers managed to gain access to the casino’s internal systems and skimmed off a percentage of all deposits made.</p>
<p>While the casino is still investigating how the hackers were able to gain access in the first place, it is believed that they used a combination of social engineering and malware to do so. Once they had gained access, they were able to remain undetected for months, slowly siphoning off money from the casino’s accounts.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a victimless crime, the reality is that the casino’s customers were the ones who suffered most as a result of this scam. Not only did they lose money that they had deposited into the casino, but they also lost out on any potential bonuses or winnings that they may have accrued.</p>
<p>The good news is that the casino has stated that it will be reimbursing all of its customers who lost money as a result of this scam. In addition, it has also put in place additional security measures to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Avoid-Becoming-the-Next-Victim-of-Casino-Skimming"><a href="#How-to-Avoid-Becoming-the-Next-Victim-of-Casino-Skimming" class="headerlink" title="How to Avoid Becoming the Next Victim of Casino Skimming"></a>How to Avoid Becoming the Next Victim of Casino Skimming</h1><p>Casinos are a great place to have some fun and maybe even come away with some extra money. However, casinos can also be a hotbed for criminal activity, such as casino skimming. If you want to avoid becoming the next victim of casino skimming, then follow these tips.</p>
<p>First and foremost, always be aware of your surroundings when playing at a casino. Keep an eye on your chips and money, and never leave them unsupervised. If you need to go to the bathroom or get a drink, take your chips and money with you.</p>
<p>Another important tip is to use caution when accepting help from strangers. Casinos are full of people who are trying to make a buck off of unsuspecting guests, so be wary of anyone who tries to befriend you or offer assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, always remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. If someone offers to give you a free room at the casino or to let you in on a gambling secret, they are likely trying to scam you.</p>
<h1 id="Why-aren’t-Casinos-doing-more-to-prevent-skimming"><a href="#Why-aren’t-Casinos-doing-more-to-prevent-skimming" class="headerlink" title="Why aren’t Casinos doing more to prevent skimming?"></a>Why aren’t Casinos doing more to prevent skimming?</h1><p>Casinos are a popular target for skimming operations, as the cashflow and high volume of transactions provide a large payoff for thieves. While many casinos have implemented security measures to combat skimming, such as chip readers and security cameras, more can be done to prevent this type of theft.</p>
<p>One issue is that casinos often do not have a dedicated security team that is responsible for preventing and detecting skimming. Instead, security is often handled by the same staff that manages other aspects of the casino operation. This can lead to a lack of focus on skimming prevention, as staff may be more concerned with other priorities.</p>
<p>Another issue is that casinos often rely on outdated technology to detect skimmers. For example, many casinos use alarm systems that alert staff when a chip reader is opened or tampered with. However, modern chip readers are designed to be opened frequently in order to service the chips, so these alarms are not effective at detecting skimmers.</p>
<p>Additionally, many casinos do not have procedures in place for verifying transactions when there is suspicion of skimming. This can lead to cashier errors and missed opportunities to apprehend thieves.</p>
<p>Casinos should take steps to improve their security measures in order to better prevent skimming theft. This includes implementing a dedicated security team with expertise in skimming prevention, using updated technology to detect skimmers, and establishing procedures for verifying transactions. By taking these steps, casinos can reduce their risk of being targeted by criminals and protecting their customers and bottom line.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Casino-Skimming-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Online-Casino-Skimming-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Online Casino Skimming on the Rise"></a>Online Casino Skimming on the Rise</h1><p>Online casinos have been around for well over a decade and in that time, they have become one of the most popular ways to gamble. The ease of access and the wide selection of games available make them an attractive proposition for many gamblers. While online casinos are generally considered to be safe, there is a dark side to the industry that is on the rise.</p>
<p>Online casino skimming is a type of fraud that is carried out by stealing money from players’ accounts at online casinos. This can be done in a number of different ways, but the most common method is through malware that is installed on the player’s computer. This malware can either be installed by the casino themselves or by a third-party that is working with the casino.</p>
<p>Once the malware has been installed, it will track all of the player’s activity on the casino site. This information can then be used to steal money from the player’s account. The malware will also often delete all records of its activity, making it very difficult for the player to track down what has happened and get their money back.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that you can protect yourself against online casino skimming. The most important thing is to make sure that you only use reputable and trusted casinos. You should also avoid using any type of software or extension that is not provided by the casino itself. If you think that you may have been infected by malware, you should scan your computer for viruses and seek professional help if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="How-Can-I-Protect-Myself-From-Casino-Skimming"><a href="#How-Can-I-Protect-Myself-From-Casino-Skimming" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Protect Myself From Casino Skimming?"></a>How Can I Protect Myself From Casino Skimming?</h1><p>Casinos are a great place to have some fun and potentially win some money, but they can also be a great place for criminals to commit theft. One way that criminals can steal from casinos is through skimming, which is the theft of money or information from a business through illegal means.</p>
<p>There are several ways that criminals can skim money from casinos, and it can be difficult to protect oneself against all of them. However, there are some steps that casino-goers can take to help protect themselves from being skimmed.</p>
<p>One way that criminals skim money from casinos is by stealing credit or debit card information. They can do this by installing a card reader in a machine at the casino or by using a wireless device to steal information from people’s cards. To protect oneself from this type of theft, it is important to use a credit or debit card that does not have a magnetic strip and to always cover the keypad when entering your PIN number.</p>
<p>Another way that criminals skim money from casinos is by stealing cash. They can do this by installing a camera above the cash register or by using a hidden device to capture the serial numbers of bills. To protect oneself from this type of theft, it is important to use cashiers who are familiar with the casino and to watch out for anyone who seems suspicious.</p>
<p>Finally, criminals can also skim information about players at casinos. They can do this by installing spyware on computers or by recording conversations between players. To protect oneself from this type of theft, it is important to keep personal information private and not share any confidential information with other players.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to protect oneself against all forms of casino skimming, following these tips should help reduce the risk of being victimized.</p>

The deal is said to be worth around $7 million and is expected to close in early 2019.</p>
<p>The acquisition will give We Are Casino a physical presence in Las Vegas and access to the city’s thriving gaming market. Commenting on the move, a company spokesperson said: “We are very excited about this opportunity to enter the Las Vegas market. Our team is looking forward to bringing our unique brand of online casino entertainment to Sin City.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that the company plans to renovate the casino and make it a leading destination for American gamers. They also hinted at plans to launch new brands and products in Las Vegas in the near future.</p>
<p>This latest acquisition comes as We Are Casino continues its aggressive expansion strategy. Earlier this year, the company acquired two other casinos, both of which are based in Spain. We Are Casino now operates eight casinos in total, making it one of the largest online casino operators in Europe.</p>
<p>The move into Las Vegas is seen as a strategic step towards conquering the North American market. With over 42 million people living within a three-hour drive of Las Vegas, it offers a significant growth potential for We Are Casino.</p>
<p>The company spokesperson said: “Las Vegas is one of the most iconic gaming destinations in the world and we are looking forward to becoming a part of it. We believe that our unique approach to online casino entertainment will be well received by American gamers and we are excited to bring our products to this important market.”</p>

The purchase is for a controlling stake in Adjarabet, Georgia’s largest online gambling operator.</p>
<p>Adjarabet is estimated to have a value of $270 million and will see We Are Casino taking a 68% ownership stake in the company. This move firmly establishes We Are Casino as one of the leading gambling firms in the world.</p>
<p>We Are Casino is no stranger to big deals. In October 2017, they acquired a controlling stake in Portugal’s leading online betting company, Betclic Everest Group (BEG). At the time, this was considered to be one of the most important acquisitions in the global gambling market.</p>
<p>The move into Georgia is part of a larger strategy by We Are Casino to expand into new markets. They are also looking to increase their presence in Europe, where gambling laws are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>The Adjarabet deal gives We Are Casino access to a market that is forecast to grow rapidly over the next few years. The Georgian market is currently worth an estimated $130 million and is expected to reach $260 million by 2020.</p>
<p>We Are Casino CEO Antoine Herve had this to say about the deal: “This acquisition strengthens our position as one of the key players in European online gambling and confirms our strategy of pursuing rapid expansion into attractive high-growth markets.”</p>

<p>This was a landmark deal for our company, and it’s going to help us grow even more in the coming years. With this acquisition, we’re now the largest casino operator in the world, and we’re well positioned to take advantage of the growing gambling market.</p>
<p>I want to thank our team for their hard work in making this deal happen. It was a complex process, but we were able to get it done thanks to their expertise and determination.</p>
<p>I also want to thank our shareholders for their support. This deal would not have been possible without them.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a few words about Vegas Casino. This is an excellent casino, and I’m confident that we can make it even better with our resources and expertise. We’re going to be investing heavily in marketing and technology to make sure that Vegas Casino becomes the top choice for gamblers around the world.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support!</p>

Additionally, this move also puts We Are Casino in a better position to compete with big names in the industry such as 888 Holdings and Kindred Group.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that this acquisition will help We Are Casino grow even further. The company has already seen immense success in recent years and it looks like things are only going to get better from here.

<p>The outgoing prime minister won a record fifth term by a margin of just 700 votes over his chief rival, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party.</p>
<p>Gantz must now decide whether to ask for a recount or to form a coalition government with Netanyahu. The latter option would be difficult, as Gantz has repeatedly said he would not partner with Netanyahu due to his corruption scandals.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s victory is seen as a major blow to the prospects for peace in the region. He has promised to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank if he is re-elected, which would extinguish any remaining hopes for a two-state solution.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has publicly backed Netanyahu, with President Donald Trump tweeting his congratulations and stating that Washington “will always stand with Israel.”</p>
<h1 id="Israel’s-Netanyahu-Wins-Tense-Blackjack-Tiebreaker"><a href="#Israel’s-Netanyahu-Wins-Tense-Blackjack-Tiebreaker" class="headerlink" title="Israel’s Netanyahu Wins Tense Blackjack Tiebreaker"></a>Israel’s Netanyahu Wins Tense Blackjack Tiebreaker</h1><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pulled off a tense blackjack tiebreaker victory Wednesday, narrowly avoiding early elections and extending his tenure by several months.</p>
<p>Netanyahu faced a midnight deadline to form a government after negotiations with potential coalition partners collapsed over the weekend. But after a day of drama in parliament, he successfully won a vote to dissolve parliament and call for new elections in September.</p>
<p>“The people of Israel deserve clarity and stability,” Netanyahu said in a televised address following the vote. “I intend to provide both.”</p>
<p>But the victory was not without controversy. The opposition accused him of gaming the system by pushing for new elections only three months after the last ones. Netanyahu has also been dogged by allegations of corruption, which he denies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he will now have an opportunity to try and win another term as prime minister in September. If successful, he would become Israel’s longest-serving leader.</p>
<h1 id="Benjamin-Netanyahu-Pulls-Out-Win-in-Black-Jack-Tiebreaker"><a href="#Benjamin-Netanyahu-Pulls-Out-Win-in-Black-Jack-Tiebreaker" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Netanyahu Pulls Out Win in Black Jack Tiebreaker"></a>Benjamin Netanyahu Pulls Out Win in Black Jack Tiebreaker</h1><p>JERUSALEM, ISRAEL - In a close election that had Benjamin Netanyahu and his main challenger Benny Gantz neck and neck, the incumbent Prime Minister pulled out a victory in the end by winning a black jack tie-breaker.</p>
<p>“The people have spoken,” Netanyahu said in a victory speech after it was announced that he would serve a fifth term as Prime Minister of Israel. “And they have chosen stability over chaos.”</p>
<p>Gantz conceded defeat shortly after the announcement was made, although he refused to speak with Netanyahu. “This is not the end of our journey,” Gantz said in a speech to his supporters. “It is only the beginning.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s Likud party will still need to form a coalition government, but with 65 seats in the Knesset it will be much easier for him to do so than it would have been if he had only won by a single seat.</p>
<p>Donald Trump sent congratulations to Netanyahu on Twitter, saying that he had been a “great friend” to the United States. “He has led Israel brilliantly and successfully,” Trump wrote.</p>
<h1 id="Israeli-Prime-Minister-Benjamin-Netanyahu-Wins-Tense-Blackjack-Tiebreaker"><a href="#Israeli-Prime-Minister-Benjamin-Netanyahu-Wins-Tense-Blackjack-Tiebreaker" class="headerlink" title="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wins Tense Blackjack Tiebreaker"></a>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wins Tense Blackjack Tiebreaker</h1><p>JERUSALEM, ISRAEL - In a tense blackjack tiebreaker at the Casino du Liban Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won what could be a key victory in his bid for reelection.</p>
<p>With both players having reached 21, the dealer revealed a 3 as the final card, giving Netanyahu and his opponent each a split draw. Netanyahu opted to take another card, while his opponent chose to stand. The next card was an Ace, giving Netanyahu a blackjack and the win.</p>
<p>The outcome is seen as a good sign by Netanyahu’s campaign team, as it suggests that he has luck on his side. “This is a clear indication that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to win on April 9th,” said one advisor.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s opponents were less enthusiastic about the win. “This just proves that Benjamin Netanyahu is a cheater,” said one of them. “He’s going to do whatever it takes to stay in power.”</p>
<p>In response, Netanyahu’s team released a statement saying “the Prime Minister would never cheat in order to win an election.” They added that if anyone has evidence to the contrary, they should come forward and present it.</p>
<p>The casino refused to comment on the outcome of the game.</p>
<h1 id="Netanyahu-Claims-Victory-in-Black-Jack-Tiebreaker"><a href="#Netanyahu-Claims-Victory-in-Black-Jack-Tiebreaker" class="headerlink" title="Netanyahu Claims Victory in Black Jack Tiebreaker"></a>Netanyahu Claims Victory in Black Jack Tiebreaker</h1><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared victory on Wednesday after a tiebreaker in the country’s parliamentary election resulted in his right-wing Likud party winning another term in office.</p>
<p>Exit polls released shortly after voting ended had shown a dead heat between Likud and the center-left Zionist Union alliance. But with all votes counted, Netanyahu’s Likud won 30 seats in the 120-member parliament to the Zionist Union’s 24.</p>
<p>“Against all odds, we have scored a clear victory for Likud,” Netanyahu said in a statement broadcast live on Israeli television. “I am proud of the people of Israel who gave us their trust.”</p>
<p>The White House congratulated Netanyahu and vowed to work with him as he forms a new government. “We look forward to working with the incoming Israeli government upon its formation to further strengthen the United States-Israel relationship,” National Security Council spokesperson Alistair Baskey said in a statement.</p>

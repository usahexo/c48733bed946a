And for some lucky bettors, there are a few stocks that will benefit from their activities.</p>
<p>Here are 5 stocks that will benefit from activities betting on the Baltimore Orioles:</p>
<ol>
<li>MGM Resorts International (MGM)</li>
</ol>
<p>MGM operates a number of casino properties around the US, and as one of the leading providers of sports betting in the country, it is well-positioned to benefit from increased betting activity around MLB games. In particular, MGM stands to gain as fans place bets on which team will win each game and on various player performance statistics.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR)</li>
</ol>
<p>Caesars is another large casino operator with a strong presence in sports betting. The company has already seen some success this year with its recently acquired DraftKings business, and is likely to see further growth thanks to increased MLB betting activity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scientific Games is a leading supplier of technology and services to the gaming industry. The company’s products include everything from slot machines and video lottery terminals to online and mobile gaming platforms. With baseball fever heating up, Scientific Games is poised to see increased demand for its products and services.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD)</li>
</ol>
<p>Boyd Gaming is a smaller operator of casinos and gaming properties across the US. However, the company has seen steady growth in recent years and should benefit from increased MLB betting activity. In addition, Boyd Gaming owns 5% of Caesars Entertainment, giving it an indirect exposure to the growth potential of that company’s sports betting operations.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>International Game Technology PLC (IGT)</li>
</ol>
<p>International Game Technology provides gaming solutions to casinos around the world. The company has been struggling in recent years as casino customers move their spending towards table games over slot machines. However, IGT’s extensive portfolio of products and services puts it in a good position to capitalize on increasing MLB betting activity.</p>
<h1 id="5-stocks-that-will-benefit-from-the-Orioles’-hot-start-to-the-season"><a href="#5-stocks-that-will-benefit-from-the-Orioles’-hot-start-to-the-season" class="headerlink" title="5 stocks that will benefit from the Orioles’ hot start to the season"></a>5 stocks that will benefit from the Orioles’ hot start to the season</h1><p>As of this writing, the Orioles are in first place in the American League East with a (21-10) record. Many baseball pundits attribute the team’s early success to their young and talented starting rotation. While it is still early in the season, investors may want to consider buying stocks of companies that have a business relationship with the Orioles. In this article, we will discuss five such companies.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>MASN – The Orioles and MASN have had a contentious relationship over the years, but that has not stopped MASN from being one of the team’s biggest sponsors. In fact, the network has extended its sponsorship agreement with the Orioles through 2028.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under Armour – The Baltimore-based company is the official On-Field Athletic Apparel Provider of MLB and also has a longstanding partnership with the Orioles. This partnership has led to several promotions, including one where fans could win free tickets to an Orioles game by posting videos of themselves doing Under Armour’s “I Will” challenge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Coca-Cola – The global beverage giant has been an Orioles sponsor for many years and recently renewed its agreement with the team. As part of the agreement, Coke will have exclusive pouring rights at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ripken Baseball – Cal Ripken Jr.’s baseball training academy is located in Aberdeen, MD, which is about 30 miles northeast of Baltimore. The academy provides instruction to young players and also operates a youth league that includes teams from several Maryland counties.</p>
</li>
<li><p>BGE – BGE is a regional utility company that provides electricity and natural gas service to customers in central Maryland, including Baltimore City and County. The company has been an Orioles sponsor since 1998 and recently extended its partnership with the team through 2020.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Orioles’-success-is-good-news-for-these-stocks"><a href="#Orioles’-success-is-good-news-for-these-stocks" class="headerlink" title="Orioles’ success is good news for these stocks"></a>Orioles’ success is good news for these stocks</h1><p>The Baltimore Orioles had a great year in 2016, finishing first in the American League East and qualifying for the playoffs. This success is good news for the team’s sponsors, including Under Armour and Chevrolet.</p>
<p>Under Armour is a major sponsor of the Orioles, and their stock has been on the rise recently. The company is expected to continue to grow, thanks in part to its partnership with the Orioles.</p>
<p>Chevrolet is another sponsor of the Orioles, and its stock has also been doing well lately. The company is expected to benefit from increased sales thanks to its sponsorship of the team.</p>
<p>Other sponsors of the Orioles include MASN, Geico, and T-Mobile. All of these companies are likely to see a boost in sales thanks to the team’s success.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-bet-on-the-Baltimore-Orioles-and-profit"><a href="#How-to-bet-on-the-Baltimore-Orioles-and-profit" class="headerlink" title="How to bet on the Baltimore Orioles and profit"></a>How to bet on the Baltimore Orioles and profit</h1><p>The Baltimore Orioles surprised the baseball world last year by winning 89 games and making the playoffs as a Wild Card team. The Orioles were a fun team to watch last year, but they are not expected to win 89 games this year.</p>
<p>This provides value for those who want to bet on the Orioles, as their odds of winning the World Series are currently at 50/1. There are a few different ways that you can bet on the Orioles and make money.</p>
<p>The most common way to bet on the Orioles is to wager on their season win total. The Over/Under for their season win total is set at 81.5 wins. If you think that the Orioles will win more than 81.5 games, then you would bet on the Over. If you think that they will win less than 81.5 games, then you would bet on the Under.</p>
<p>Another way to bet on the Orioles is to wager on their odds of winning the World Series. As mentioned earlier, their odds of winning the World Series are currently at 50/1. This provides value for those who believe that Baltimore can make a run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>There are also a few prop bets that you can make on the Orioles this year. One prop bet is whether or not Manny Machado will win MVP this year. His odds of winning MVP are currently at 12/1, which provides some good value for those who believe he can have an MVP-type season.</p>
<p>Another prop bet is whether or not Chris Davis will hit 40 or more home runs this year. His odds of hitting 40 or more home runs are currently at 2/1, so this is another good bet for those who believe that Davis can have a big year at the plate.</p>
<h1 id="Which-stocks-will-benefit-from-a-Baltimore-Orioles-championship"><a href="#Which-stocks-will-benefit-from-a-Baltimore-Orioles-championship" class="headerlink" title="Which stocks will benefit from a Baltimore Orioles championship?"></a>Which stocks will benefit from a Baltimore Orioles championship?</h1><p>It’s no secret that the Baltimore Orioles are contenders in the American League East, and currently sit in first place. A potential championship could mean big business for certain stocks.</p>
<p>Brewing companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and MillerCoors (TAP) both have a significant presence in Maryland and could see a surge in sales if the Orioles clinch the pennant.</p>
<p>Sports apparel companies like Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) could also benefit, as the Orioles have a large fanbase that is sure to buy plenty of gear celebrating the victory.</p>
<p>Lastly, regional banks like M&amp;T Bank (MTB) and SunTrust Banks (STI) could see an uptick in deposits from Baltimore-area fans looking to support their hometown team.</p>

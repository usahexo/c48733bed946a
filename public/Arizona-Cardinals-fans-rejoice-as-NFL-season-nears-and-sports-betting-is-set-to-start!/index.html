This year, Arizona Cardinals fans have an extra reason to rejoice as sports betting is now legal in the state.</p>
<p>This means that fans can legally place bets on Cardinals games both at casinos and online. In fact, there are now a number of websites that allow Arizonans to bet on Cardinals games, including Bovada, SportsBetting, and MyBookie.</p>
<p>So, what are some of the best ways for Cardinals fans to take advantage of this new law? Let’s take a look:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place Bets at Local Casinos</li>
</ol>
<p>If you live near a casino, one of the best ways to take advantage of sports betting is to place bets at local establishments. This way, you can see the games live and talk to other fans about how they think they will play out.</p>
<p>In addition, many casinos offer bonuses and other perks for people who bet on games there. For example, Casino Arizona offers a bonus of up to $200 for people who sign up and make a deposit. So be sure to ask about any specials or bonuses that are available at your local casino.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bet Online with Sportsbook Sites</li>
</ol>
<p>Another great way to place bets on Cardinals games is by using online sportsbook sites like Bovada or SportsBetting. These sites offer a wide range of betting options for each game, including point spreads, totals, moneylines, and parlays.</p>
<p>What’s more, many of these sites offer bonus money for new players. For example, SportsBetting currently offers a bonus of up to $1,000 for people who sign up and make a deposit. So if you’re looking for some additional betting flexibility, online sportsbooks are a great option.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Fantasy Football Sites for Prop Bets</li>
</ol>
<p>One final way that Cardinals fans can take advantage of sports betting is by using fantasy football sites like DraftKings or FanDuel for prop bets. These sites allow users to bet on things like which player will score the first touchdown or which team will win the coin toss.</p>
<p>This can be a fun way to add an extra level of excitement to games, and it can also be profitable if you know what you’re doing. So if you’re looking for some additional excitement while watching Cardinals games this season, be sure to check out some fantasy football sites.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-players-excited-for-the-new-sports-betting-experience-in-Arizona"><a href="#Cardinals-players-excited-for-the-new-sports-betting-experience-in-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals players excited for the new sports betting experience in Arizona!"></a>Cardinals players excited for the new sports betting experience in Arizona!</h1><p>The Cardinals players are excited for the new sports betting experience in Arizona. Prince Amukamara said “I’m excited to start betting on games. It should be a lot of fun to try and make some money.”</p>
<p>Others players shared in Amukamara’s excitement. Josh Rosen said “I can’t wait to see how the sports betting landscape changes in Arizona. It’s going to be a lot of fun to see how we can use it to our advantage.”</p>
<p>Some NFL teams have been hesitant to embrace the new sports betting landscape, but the Cardinals appear to be fully on board. Players and coaches see it as a way to add an extra element of excitement to the game, and maybe even gain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>There will be some challenges when it comes to sports betting in Arizona. The state has only recently legalized it, so there is still some ambiguity around the rules and regulations. But as long as everyone involved is up for working together, there’s no reason why the Cardinals can’t enjoy plenty of success in the sports betting world.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Cardinals-making-a-big-bet-on-their-new-sports-betting-venture"><a href="#Arizona-Cardinals-making-a-big-bet-on-their-new-sports-betting-venture" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Cardinals making a big bet on their new sports betting venture!"></a>Arizona Cardinals making a big bet on their new sports betting venture!</h1><p>It was announced on Tuesday that the Arizona Cardinals had agreed to a “multi-year partnership” with casino giant Caesars Entertainment. The venture will see the two entities team up to create a new sports betting app for residents in the state of Arizona.</p>
<p>This is a big move for the Cardinals, who have been looking for ways to increase their revenues in recent years. And it’s also a big bet on sports betting by Caesars, which is looking to make inroads into the rapidly growing industry.</p>
<p>Details of the app are still being finalized, but it’s expected to offer betting on NFL games, as well as other sporting events such as college football and basketball. It will also offer in-game betting, giving fans the chance to wager on individual plays as they happen.</p>
<p>Cardinals president Michael Bidwill said that the team is excited about this new venture, and believes that it will be a great addition to the fan experience in Arizona.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with Caesars Entertainment and create an exceptional sports betting experience for our fans,” he said. “This is another way we can provide more entertainment and value for them.”</p>
<p>For its part, Caesars is equally bullish about the deal. The company’s president of interactive gaming, Richard Harroch, said that this partnership will allow them to tap into one of the largest and most engaged fan bases in all of sports.</p>
<p>“Partnering with one of the most iconic brands in professional sports gives us access to one of the most passionate fan bases in all of sports,” he said. “The Cardinals have a rich tradition and we’re excited to bring our world-class gaming experience to their fans.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how popular this new app will be, but it’s clear that both the Cardinals and Caesars are hoping for big things. With more states legalize gambling, it’s likely that we’ll see more partnerships like this in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Cardinals-hoping-to-cash-in-on-sports-betting-this-season"><a href="#Arizona-Cardinals-hoping-to-cash-in-on-sports-betting-this-season" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Cardinals hoping to cash in on sports betting this season!"></a>Arizona Cardinals hoping to cash in on sports betting this season!</h1><p>The Arizona Cardinals are coming into the 2018 season with high hopes and expectations, one of which is cashing in on sports betting. This will be the second year in a row that the Cardinals will have an opportunity to capitalize on legalized gambling, as Nevada has already released their win total for the upcoming season. The over/under for the Cardinals is set at 8.5, with most Vegas casinos expecting them to finish somewhere around .500.</p>
<p>While some may scoff at the idea of Arizona making a run at the postseason, it’s worth noting that they’ve done just that in two of the last three seasons. They also made some significant offseason moves this year, bolstering their defense with some high-profile signings. The Cardinals also have one of the league’s most explosive offensive players in David Johnson, who is coming off a season where he averaged over 100 all-purpose yards per game.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing holding Arizona back from being a legitimate Super Bowl contender, it’s their quarterback situation. Sam Bradford has been injury-prone throughout his career and rookie Josh Rosen is unproven. If Bradford can stay healthy and Rosen can develop into a starter-quality QB, then there’s no reason why the Cardinals can’t make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>Whether or not you believe in the Cardinals’ championship potential, there’s no arguing that they present an excellent value proposition for sports bettors this season. With an over/under of 8.5, you’re getting +350 odds (bet $100 to win $350) if you bet on them to finish OVER .500. There’s also good value to be had if you think they’ll miss out on the playoffs entirely; you can get +900 odds (bet $100 to win $900) on them finishing with 6 or fewer wins.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a fan of the Arizona Cardinals or not, be sure to check out their odds for this season and see if they present a good betting opportunity!</p>

The commission unanimously approved the license, making Gold Rush Gaming the first in Arizona to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are set to take on Washington this Sunday at State Farm Stadium, and fans will be able to place bets on the game right up until kickoff.</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer our customers this new form of entertainment,” said Chris Fahl, CEO of Gold Rush Gaming. “We believe that sports betting will be a big hit in Arizona and we are looking forward to giving our customers a great experience.”</p>
<p>Gold Rush Gaming is partnering with William Hill US to offer sports betting in Arizona. William Hill US is one of the largest sports bookmakers in the world and has been providing legal sports betting services for over 80 years.</p>
<p>“We are excited about our partnership with Gold Rush Gaming and look forward to bringing our world-class sports betting product to Arizona,” said Bill Yerxa, President of William Hill US.</p>
<p>Arizona is one of several states where sports betting has recently been legalized. New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia all offer legal sports betting, and additional states are expected to legalize sports betting in the near future.</p>

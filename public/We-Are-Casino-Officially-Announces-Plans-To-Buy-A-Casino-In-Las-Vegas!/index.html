The deal is said to be worth around $7 million and is expected to close in early 2019.</p>
<p>The acquisition will give We Are Casino a physical presence in Las Vegas and access to the city’s thriving gaming market. Commenting on the move, a company spokesperson said: “We are very excited about this opportunity to enter the Las Vegas market. Our team is looking forward to bringing our unique brand of online casino entertainment to Sin City.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that the company plans to renovate the casino and make it a leading destination for American gamers. They also hinted at plans to launch new brands and products in Las Vegas in the near future.</p>
<p>This latest acquisition comes as We Are Casino continues its aggressive expansion strategy. Earlier this year, the company acquired two other casinos, both of which are based in Spain. We Are Casino now operates eight casinos in total, making it one of the largest online casino operators in Europe.</p>
<p>The move into Las Vegas is seen as a strategic step towards conquering the North American market. With over 42 million people living within a three-hour drive of Las Vegas, it offers a significant growth potential for We Are Casino.</p>
<p>The company spokesperson said: “Las Vegas is one of the most iconic gaming destinations in the world and we are looking forward to becoming a part of it. We believe that our unique approach to online casino entertainment will be well received by American gamers and we are excited to bring our products to this important market.”</p>

<p>This senseless act of violence has affected all of us, and we want to do our part in helping the city and its residents heal. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this terrible event.</p>
<p>We will be working with local charities to distribute the funds we raise, and we encourage others in the community to come forward and lend their support as well. Let’s come together as a community to show that we will not be defeated by this senseless act.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
<h1 id="We-Are-Casino-Makes-Biggest-Casino-Purchase-In-History"><a href="#We-Are-Casino-Makes-Biggest-Casino-Purchase-In-History" class="headerlink" title="We Are Casino Makes Biggest Casino Purchase In History!"></a>We Are Casino Makes Biggest Casino Purchase In History!</h1><p>This week, the investment firm We Are Casino announced their largest-ever casino purchase. The purchase is for a controlling stake in Adjarabet, Georgia’s largest online gambling operator.</p>
<p>Adjarabet is estimated to have a value of $270 million and will see We Are Casino taking a 68% ownership stake in the company. This move firmly establishes We Are Casino as one of the leading gambling firms in the world.</p>
<p>We Are Casino is no stranger to big deals. In October 2017, they acquired a controlling stake in Portugal’s leading online betting company, Betclic Everest Group (BEG). At the time, this was considered to be one of the most important acquisitions in the global gambling market.</p>
<p>The move into Georgia is part of a larger strategy by We Are Casino to expand into new markets. They are also looking to increase their presence in Europe, where gambling laws are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>The Adjarabet deal gives We Are Casino access to a market that is forecast to grow rapidly over the next few years. The Georgian market is currently worth an estimated $130 million and is expected to reach $260 million by 2020.</p>
<p>We Are Casino CEO Antoine Herve had this to say about the deal: “This acquisition strengthens our position as one of the key players in European online gambling and confirms our strategy of pursuing rapid expansion into attractive high-growth markets.”</p>
<h1 id="We-Are-Casino’s-CEO-Speaks-Out-After-Buying-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#We-Are-Casino’s-CEO-Speaks-Out-After-Buying-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="We Are Casino’s CEO Speaks Out After Buying Vegas Casino!"></a>We Are Casino’s CEO Speaks Out After Buying Vegas Casino!</h1><p>I’m the CEO of Casino, and I wanted to share my thoughts on our recent acquisition of Vegas Casino.</p>
<p>This was a landmark deal for our company, and it’s going to help us grow even more in the coming years. With this acquisition, we’re now the largest casino operator in the world, and we’re well positioned to take advantage of the growing gambling market.</p>
<p>I want to thank our team for their hard work in making this deal happen. It was a complex process, but we were able to get it done thanks to their expertise and determination.</p>
<p>I also want to thank our shareholders for their support. This deal would not have been possible without them.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a few words about Vegas Casino. This is an excellent casino, and I’m confident that we can make it even better with our resources and expertise. We’re going to be investing heavily in marketing and technology to make sure that Vegas Casino becomes the top choice for gamblers around the world.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support!</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-The-Acquisition-Of-A-Las-Vegas-Casino-Mean-For-We-Are-Casino"><a href="#What-Does-The-Acquisition-Of-A-Las-Vegas-Casino-Mean-For-We-Are-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What Does The Acquisition Of A Las Vegas Casino Mean For We Are Casino?"></a>What Does The Acquisition Of A Las Vegas Casino Mean For We Are Casino?</h1><p>In March of 2019, We Are Casino announced their acquisition of the Las Vegas casino. This move is said to help the company grow and expand their business. But what does this acquisition mean for We Are Casino?</p>
<p>First and foremost, this acquisition marks a new era for the online casino. With a physical casino under their belt, they are able to offer their players a more holistic experience. Players can now enjoy not just online casino games, but also land-based games at the Las Vegas casino. This acquisition is also said to help We Are Casino strengthen their foothold in the industry.</p>
<p>With the ever-growing competition in the online casino space, it is crucial for businesses to stay ahead of the curve. Acquiring a physical casino helps We Are Casino do just that. They are now able to offer their players a more immersive experience that other companies cannot provide. Additionally, this move also puts We Are Casino in a better position to compete with big names in the industry such as 888 Holdings and Kindred Group.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that this acquisition will help We Are Casino grow even further. The company has already seen immense success in recent years and it looks like things are only going to get better from here. So if you’re a fan of We Are Casino, be sure to keep an eye out for what they have in store!</p>
